Create a Notes API using .NET 5.
The Notes API will allow a consumer to manage personal notes.
The consumer of the API is able to get a list of notes, get details on a specific note, and create, update, and delete a note.
You do not need to use a database. Just mock out what would be done with sample data.
No authentication is required.
